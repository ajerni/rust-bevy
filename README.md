# Bevyengine Game with Rust - Andi's Learning Experiences

This is a simple game built using the Rust programming language and Bevyengine. It demonstrates basic game development concepts such as entity component systems (ECS), event handling, state management and even a database connection (see my Rust-SQLX and Actix Web repo) and serves as my personal sandbox and documentation for learning and experimenting with Rust and Bevyengine. The game includes features like spawning entities, collision detection, UI management and state transitions.

## Features

- **Entity Spawning**: Spawn various entities such as spaceships, buttons, and particles.
- **Collision Detection**: Detect collisions between entities and react accordingly.
- **UI Management**: Show or hide UI elements based on game states.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of the player's score and update the high score.
- **State Transitions**: Transition between different game states like playing and paused.
- **Physics Simulation**: Simulate physics interactions using the Rapier physics engine.
